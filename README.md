# Dumpon üóëÔ∏è Go HTTP Request Dump Server

**Dumpon** is a simple HTTP server designed to dump information about incoming HTTP requests written in Go. It prints details such as request URL, method, headers, parameters, body and file uploads to the console.

## Notes

- I made this to have a portable dump server with me, usable anywhere at anytime, for debugging requests.
- This is my first project in Go lang so suggestion and pull requests are welcome from experts.

## Installation

You can download the binary from [release](../../releases) page or build on your own from source. Ensure that Go^1.22.6 is installed and properly configured on your system to build from source.

## Usage

```bash
# See available options
./dumpon -h

# Run the server
# Default port `-p 80`
# Max memory `-m 10`
./dumpon
```

## Sending Request

```bash
# Simple GET request
curl http://localhost:80

# Simple POST request with body
curl -X POST http://localhost:80 -d "name=dumpon"

# Simple POST request with file upload
curl -X POST http://localhost:80 -F "avatar=@path/to/avatar.png"
```

Each request is separated by start and end boundary.
